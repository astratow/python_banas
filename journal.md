### Miles to kilometers converter
[Miles to kilometers](mile2km-converter.py)
illustrates using input from the user and change from string (default input) into float and uses ```format()```
method to insert variable value into the string to output on the console.

```print("{} miles is {} kilometers".format(miles, kilometers))```
### Calculator

[Calculator](calculator.py)
was an exercise to illustrate ```if/elif/else``` statements, used ```split()```
method to create three variables out of the input string. I learnt about taking input, sorting it and displaying.

```print("{} + {} = {}".format(num_1, num_2, num_1 + num_2))```
### Pine tree generator

[Pine tree generator](pine-tree.py) is ascii code art generator. It generates a tree.
I still don't understand how it does what it does, but user inputs number of levels and it prints out the tree.
